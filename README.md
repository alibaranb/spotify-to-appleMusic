Designed to transfer your spotify playlists to apple music.

Lets assume you are using a Spotify Downloader Website to download your Spotify Albums. You most likely will get your music names likes in the picture below.

But don't worry :). All you gotta do is to type what you want to delete. (It is "[SPOTIFY-DOWNLOADER.COM] " in our example.) Then it is going to look like this.

Last step is to fix the metadata of Album Artist and Artist. Because when we download from those kind of websites, just single metadata is filled and this results in Apple Music going crazy and can not decide what to show. To fix thisi it is takes one more button to click (Fix artist names). Then it will look like this.

Everything is done :). Now you are free to upload your musics to your Apple device. Finished musics contain :
- Album cover
- Album name
- Artist names
